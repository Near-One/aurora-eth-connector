Aurora Eth Connecotr - Fungible Token implementation is the smart contract on the NEAR Protocol for
[Aurora Engine](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine).
It is implementation for [NEP-141](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleToken/Core).

It is base on [AIP:  Split NEP-141 logic outside of Engine](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/AIPs/pull/5).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly (2022-08-08) with the WebAssembly toolchain
- cargo-make

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

#### Running unit & integration tests

To run tests, there are a few cargo make tasks we can run:

- `test`, tests the whole cargo workspace and ETH contracts. Requires a
  `--profile` argument.

For example, the following will test the whole workspace and ETH contracts:

```sh
cargo make --profile mainnet test 
```

### Building & Make Commands

Every task with `cargo make` must have a `--profile` argument.

The current available `profile`s are:

- `mainnet`, suitable for mainnet.
- `testnet`, suitable for testnet.
- `local`, suitable for local development.
- `custom`, suitable for custom environments, see note below.

A custom environment may be required depending on the circumstances. This can
be created in the `.env` folder as `custom.env` following the structure of the
other `.env` files. See `bin/local-custom.env` for more details.

Every make most follow the following pattern, though `--profile` is not required
for all such as cleanup:

```sh
cargo make [--profile <profile>] <task>
```

#### Building the aurora-eth-connector contract

To build the binaries there are a few commands to do such following the format.

The current available build `task`s are:

- `default`, does not need to be specified, runs `build`. Requires a `--profile`
  argument.
- `build`, builds smart contract and produces the
  `aurora-<profile>.wasm` in the `bin` folder.
  Requires a `--profile` argument.
- `build-test`, builds all the below using test features. Requires a `--profile`
  argument.
- `build-migration`, builds smart contract with migration functionality and produces the
  `aurora-<profile>.wasm` in the `bin` folder.

For example, the following will build the mainnet debug binary:

```sh
cargo make --profile mainnet build
```

#### Running checks & lints

To run lints and checks, the following tasks are available:

- `check`, checks the format, clippy and ETH contracts.
- `check-fmt`, checks the workspace Rust format only.
- `check-clippy`, checks the Rust workspace with clippy only.

For example the following command will run the checks. `profile` is not required
here:

```sh
cargo make check
```
